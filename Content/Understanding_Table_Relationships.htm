        <h1><a name="kanchor8"></a>Understanding Table Relationships</h1>
        <p>You create relationships between tables to prevent redundant data. In 
 most cases, the name of the field is identical in both tables, but this 
 is not always the case. The relationship between two tables is based on 
 both tables having at least one identical field.</p>
        <p>For example, in the <span class="MyVariablesProduct Name">Infor CRM</span> database, the <a href="A_Tables/ACCOUNT_Table.htm">ACCOUNT</a> 
 and <a href="C_Tables/COMMODITYGROUP_Table.htm">CONTACT</a> tables are 
 related because they each contain an AccountID field with the same value. 
 However, the ACCOUNT table is also related to the <a href="U_Tables/USERINFO_Table.htm">USERINFO</a> 
 table through the AccountManagerID field in the ACCOUNT table, and the 
 UserID field in the USERINFO table. Although the field names are different, 
 the ACCOUNT and USERINFO tables are related.</p>

        <p>For more information about table relationships, see the Data Relationships 
 topic in the Administrator or Architect help.</p>
        <p>Tables can have several types of relationships:</p>
        <p>(One) to (One) - For a single record in one table there is only one 
 related record in another table. For example, a contact is related to 
 only one account; therefore, the relationship between the CONTACT and 
 ACCOUNT tables is One to One.</p>
        <p>(One) to (Many) - For a single record in one table there are one or 
 more related records in another table. For example, more than one contact 
 can be associated with an account, but at least one account is always 
 associated with a contact; therefore, the relationship between the ACCOUNT 
 and CONTACT tables is One to Many.</p>
        <p>(Many) to (Many) - There are many records in one table that relate to 
 many records in another table. For example, a user can have many activities 
 and an activity can have many users. Therefore, the relationship between 
 the USERINFO and ACTIVITY tables is Many to Many. You cannot work with 
 tables that have a Many to Many relationship directly. You must use a 
 link table, an intermediary table that resolves Many to Many relationships 
 by creating a link between the tables. If you need information from the 
 USERINFO and ACTIVITY tables, use the USER_ACTIVITY as the link table 
 to access these tables.</p>
